        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Mikiyas — a Computer Science student at Hawassa University and the creator of this site. I'm passionate about building intuitive web experiences, learning new technologies, and solving real-world problems through code.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I’m not coding, I’m usually reading novels, learning UI/UX design, or experimenting with new side projects. My goal is to create tools that are both beautiful and useful — and to keep growing as a developer.
